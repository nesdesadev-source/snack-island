# 🏝️ Snack Island POS — Project Plan

A lightweight Point of Sale (POS) system built for **Snack Island**, our food truck business.  
It manages **orders, sales, expenses, and inventory**, including hard-to-measure liquids like oil and iced tea concentrate.  
The system is powered by **Vue** (frontend) and **Supabase** (backend + database).

## 🍔 1. Project Overview

**Goal:**  
Create a POS that works locally (on tablet or laptop), tracks daily sales and inventory, and generates **CSV sales reports** with a visual **dashboard** — all using Supabase for data management.

**Main Features:**
- Order and Combo Management  
- Real-time Sales Tracking  
- Inventory System (solid & liquid)  
- Expense Logging  
- CSV Export for Daily Reports  
- Interactive Dashboard

## 🧠 4. How the System Works (Layman’s Logic)

### 🧾 A. Orders
1. Staff selects items or combos (like *Fries + Iced Tea*).  
2. POS records the order, calculates total, and saves it to Supabase.  
3. When order is marked as “Completed,” the system automatically updates inventory based on each item’s recipe.

**Example:**
> Cheese Fries → deduct 1 potato (solid), 0.05L oil (liquid), 0.03L cheese sauce (liquid).

---

### 📦 B. Inventory
Tracks **everything used in production**, both solid and liquid.

#### 🔹 For Solid Items (e.g., cups, potatoes)
- Each order deducts a fixed amount per sale (based on recipe).
- System triggers a “Low Stock” alert when below the reorder level.

#### 🔹 For Liquids (e.g., oil, sauces, tea concentrate)
Liquids are tricky to measure, so we use **estimated usage** or **batch logic**.

1. **Estimated Usage per Order**
   - Every menu item has an average consumption (like 0.05L oil per fries).
   - The system auto-deducts this estimated value per sale.

2. **Batch Tracking**
   - You define how much liquid is used for a “batch.”  
   - Example: 5L of fryer oil = 100 fries.  
   - Each fries order adds +1 serving to that batch count.  
   - When batch reaches 100 servings → system alerts: *“Replace oil batch.”*

3. **Manual Adjustments**
   - At closing, staff checks actual oil left and updates the count.
   - System adjusts automatically to match the real measurement.

---

### 💰 C. Sales
- Every completed order automatically adds to daily sales in Supabase.  
- Dashboard totals up all orders by date.  
- At the end of the day, a CSV file is generated with:
  - Total sales
  - Number of orders
  - Total expenses
  - Net profit
  - Top-selling item

---

### 🧾 D. Expenses
- Logged manually by staff (e.g., ₱200 for oil, ₱150 for gas).
- Stored in Supabase under `expenses`.
- Automatically included in daily profit calculations.

---

### 📊 E. Reports
At day’s end, the system exports a **CSV file** like this:

| Date | Orders | Gross Sales | Expenses | Net Profit | Top Item |
|------|---------|--------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| 2025-10-08 | 52 | ₱4,850 | ₱1,100 | ₱3,750 | Cheese Fries |

The CSV is created using Vue’s front-end export function and can be downloaded or sent via email.

---

### 📈 F. Dashboard
Built using **Chart.js or ApexCharts**, showing:

- Total Sales (Today, Week, Month)
- Top 5 Best-Selling Items
- Expense Breakdown
- Profit Trends
- Stock Levels (color-coded)
- Liquid Efficiency (Expected vs. Actual Use)

## 🔄 6. Logic Flow Summary (Plain English)

### When an Order is Placed:
1. Staff selects menu items → POS saves order to Supabase.  
2. For each item:
   - System looks up its recipe in `recipe_map`.  
   - For solids → deduct fixed quantity from stock.  
   - For liquids → either:
     - Deduct estimated usage directly, or  
     - Add 1 serving to active batch count (if using batch logic).  
3. When batch limit is reached → system alerts to replace liquid.

---

### At Closing Time:
1. Staff checks actual stock (especially liquids).  
2. Enter adjustments into POS (e.g., “8.5L oil left”).  
3. POS corrects inventory accordingly.  
4. Log all expenses for the day.  
5. Click “Export CSV” → downloads daily report automatically.  
6. Dashboard updates all charts using Supabase data.
